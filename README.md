# ShowHandlesEverywhere.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert. It displays handles for paths in the background, as well as in inactive glyphs surrounding the current glyph.

After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Handles Everywhere*.
You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.

### Installation

1. Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
2. Double click the .glyphsReporter file. Confirm the dialog that appears in Glyphs.
3. Restart Glyphs

### Usage Instructions

1. Open a glyph in Edit View.
2. Use *View > Show Handles Everywhere* to toggle the display of coordinates for selected nodes.
3. Turn on *View > Show Background* if you want to see handles in the background paths.
4. Turn off *View > Fill Preview* to show handles in the surrounding glyphs in Edit view.

### Known Problems

If you use it with a lot of text, the plugin can slow down the app significantly. So, I advise to only use it with small bits of text, perhaps one or two words.
